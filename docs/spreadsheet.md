# The Spreadsheet

The example spreadsheet found in the `templates` directory shows how to format projects, resources and specific dates.

## Adding a Project

To add a project, simply add to column A a "slug" *(No longer than four characters for formatting reasons)* and then a hex color value one space after the slug.

## Adding a Project to a Resource

To add a project to a resource, edit the specific day and type the project's 
"slug" into the field.

## Marking a date as a "Deliverable"

Certain dates are needed to be marked as "Deliverables". In order to achieve this, append to a projects slug "-DLVR" in the date's field. This will mark the day with a red border in the build.
