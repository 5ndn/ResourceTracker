# Five & Done Resource Tracker

To get a build of the resource tracker running, you only need a properly filled out `config.js` file and our example spreadsheet uploaded to your Google Drive & made into a native Google Sheet.

## Table of Contents

- [Setting up the config.js](./config.md)
- [Explaining the Google Sheet](./spreadsheet.md)

## Minor Notes

The tracker will use a resource's name to fetch the resource's photo. So the name "John Doe" will automatically try and fetch "JohnDoe.jpg" from the `images` directory. Name your resource's images following this pattern.
